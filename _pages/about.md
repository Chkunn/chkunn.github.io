I am a PhD candidate in Department of Sociology at Zhejiang University. My research interest centers on the mental health outcomes of younger generations. I am currently exploring my dissertation topic, which might be the
anxiety experienced by college students. 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. <br>

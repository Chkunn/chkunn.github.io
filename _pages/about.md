I am a PhD candidate in Department of Sociology at Zhejiang University.My research interest centers on child and adolescent well-being, and social mentality. I am currently exploring my thesis topic, which might be the
anxiety experienced by college students. 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussionsand collaborations. 

Feel free to reach out to me at kunn@zju.edu.cn.

For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template.

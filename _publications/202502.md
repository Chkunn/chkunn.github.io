excerpt: 'This study examines how Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) shape the structure and temporal dynamics of mental health symptoms from early to middle adulthood. Using longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), we analyzed Wave 4 (ages 24–32) and Wave 5 (ages 32–42). Cross-sectional and cross-lagged panel network analyses (CLPN) were applied to six symptoms: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts, stratified by ACE exposure. Results showed that childhood abuse and anxiety were central in early adulthood, whereas depression became most central in middle adulthood, reflecting a developmental shift in network structure. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts consistently acted as bridge symptoms, linking otherwise distinct clusters. Among individuals with ACEs, anxiety functioned as a transdiagnostic initiator, predicting the onset and amplification of multiple symptoms over time, while networks among those without ACEs were less interconnected. These findings indicate that ACEs not only elevate psychiatric risk but also shape the complexity, density, and directional flow of symptom networks across adulthood. Identifying central and bridge symptoms through network modeling highlights potential targets for developmentally informed interventions. The application of cross-lagged network analysis further advances methodological approaches to clarifying potential causal pathways in population mental health research.'

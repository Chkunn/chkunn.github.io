excerpt: 'The current study explored the bridge symptoms between parental involvement and depression and the sex difference between this network. The participants included 772 adolescents (50.06% girl, M age = 11.77, SD = 0.72) in China. They were recruited to complete the questionnaires regarding parental involvement and depression. Results showed that the network had eight bridge symptoms (pi6, pi12, pi17, pi20, pi21, dp8, dp12, dp16). Besides, there were significant sex differences between symptom networks. The network structure invariance test revealed significant differences in the overall network structure between the networks for boys and girls.'
